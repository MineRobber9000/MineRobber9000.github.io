###ThePokeBot Info

The ["PokeBot project"](http://github.com/kylecoburn/pokebot) was created by GitHub user "kylecoburn", and is a memory based bot for Pokemon Red and Yellow.
This is the project I wish to eventually help make better.

###What does it do?

[The version of ThePokeBot that kylecoburn runs is streamed on twitch.](http://www.twitch.tv/thepokebot/)

You can [download the bot](http://github.com/kylecoburn/pokebot) and run it yourself.

There have also been forks of ThePokeBot that make it run different categories (stock ThePokeBot runs Any% Glitchless); Like [bouletmarc's rendition.](https://github.com/bouletmarc/PokeBot Red Any% Glitchless (Red Only))
