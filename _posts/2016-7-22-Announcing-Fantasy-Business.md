Fantasy Business is a game my friend Jackson and I made up. Here is how it works:

1. Gather up to 6 friends.
2. A list of companies has been provided on the [blank playing spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u1fSIw64xnA6kmYNQsiZYfRRQ9PG0YyDt0NspBuPF0Q/edit?usp=sharing), (make a copy of it and store it in Google Drive, it has some useful features) but if you need more for you and your friends, brainstorm more companies and add them to the list.
3. Follow the rules as set out by [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WHcgMZMUZUc0fAGVDbTCqzScZu6tMiQJmgJcxtco5j0/edit?usp=sharing) document.
