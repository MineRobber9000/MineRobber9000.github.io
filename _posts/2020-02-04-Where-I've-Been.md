title: Where I've Been
---

So, it's been almost 3 years since I used this blog. I'm archiving it as an example of what 12-year-old me thought was good blog content. Since I last posted, here's what I've been working on:

 - I fell into and out of love with [Neocities](https://minerobber.neocities.org/).
 - I'm an admin on one of the biggest [tildes](https://tildeverse.org) on the internet.
 - I've got a few new projects and a few more friends.
 
 As I said, I'm archiving this blog after this post. I want to do something new with my GitHub pages site. This blog will still be here, but it's not going to stay in the same place.
 
 So goodbye for now, and I'll see you wherever I decide to start up a blog again.
