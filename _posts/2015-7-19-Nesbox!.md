title: Nesbox!

I've learned a bit about how to use [Nesbox](http://www.nesbox.com).

For starters, you can specify a rom file instead of giving visitors a prompt to choose a file from their computer.

You can also deploy it as part of your website. As soon as I know how to write html posts, expect a post with SMB3 and S3&K emulated.
